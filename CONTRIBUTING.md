Before submitting a PR, sync with the upstream main branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
````

## 7. 💬 Commit Message Guidelines

## 9. 👀 Review Process

### 🔎 What Maintainers Look For

During review, we assess:

1. **Correctness**: Does the code work as intended?
2. **Quality**: Is it clean, readable, and maintainable?
3. **Tests**: Are there tests? Do they cover edge cases?
4. **Documentation**: Are changes documented?
5. **Performance**: Does it impact performance negatively?
6. **SOLID Principles**: Does it follow our architecture patterns?
7. **Code Style**: Does it match the project's conventions?

### 💬 Responding to Feedback

**During review, you may receive feedback.** This is normal and valuable!

1. **Read carefully**: Understand the concern
2. **Ask for clarification**: If unclear, ask questions
3. **Make changes**: Address feedback constructively
4. **Respond**: Explain your changes and reasoning
5. **Re-request review**: After addressing feedback

### 🎯 Code Review Etiquette

✅ **DO:**

- Be respectful and professional
- Assume good intent
- Ask questions, don't demand
- Explain your reasoning
- Thank reviewers for their time

## 10. 🧪 Testing Standards

### ▶️ Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run specific test file
pnpm test ArrayList.test.ts
```

### 📊 Test Coverage Expectation

**We require 100% code coverage for new code.**

If your PR decreases coverage, it will not be accepted.

### ✏️ Writing Tests

Use **Vitest** (our testing framework).

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { ArrayList } from "../src";

describe("ArrayList", () => {
  describe("add", () => {
    it("should add element to the list", () => {
      const list = new ArrayList<number>();
      list.add(1);
      expect(list.get(0)).toBe(1);
    });

    it("should throw when adding undefined", () => {
      const list = new ArrayList<string>();
      expect(() => list.add(undefined as any)).toThrow();
    });
  });

  describe("get", () => {
    it("should throw when index is out of bounds", () => {
      const list = new ArrayList<number>();
      expect(() => list.get(0)).toThrow();
    });
  });
});
```

### ✔️ Test Coverage Checklist

For new features/fixes, include tests for:

- ✅ Happy path (normal usage)
- ✅ Edge cases (empty, single element, large dataset)
- ✅ Error conditions (invalid input, out of bounds)
- ✅ Type safety (wrong types)

### 🤖 CI Requirements

All tests must pass in CI before merging:

- ✅ Unit tests (Vitest)
- ✅ Linting (ESLint)
- ✅ Type checking (TypeScript)
- ✅ Code coverage (100%)
